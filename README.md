# 32-bit-ALU
I designed and implemented a 32-bit Arithmetic Logical Unit (ALU) using Questa Sim, leveraging RTL (Register Transfer Level) design and test bench codes. The ALU is a vital component in processors, performing a wide range of arithmetic and logical operations essential for computational tasks. My design supports various functionalities, including arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as logical operations like AND, OR, XOR, and NOT. It also incorporates advanced features such as shift operations, comparison functions, and bitwise manipulations, making it versatile and efficient.

The design adheres to a modular architecture, with distinct blocks for arithmetic and logical operations to enhance maintainability and scalability. I utilized efficient Verilog HDL constructs, including parameterized modules, always blocks, and case statements, ensuring flexibility and ease of integration. A comprehensive test bench was developed to validate the design rigorously. This test bench simulated numerous test cases, including edge scenarios such as overflow and underflow, to ensure the ALU's reliability and robustness. Monitors and assertions were used to verify outputs against expected results for various inputs.

The schematic result of the ALU provides a clear visualization of the design's architecture, showcasing interconnected modules, data flow pathways, and control signal connections. This schematic highlights optimized resource utilization, which minimizes gate delays and power consumption. Simulation and validation using Questa Sim allowed for thorough analysis of timing and waveform results, ensuring proper synchronization and compliance with design specifications. Iterative refinements improved the ALUâ€™s performance, reducing latency and enhancing throughput.

This 32-bit ALU design demonstrates high reliability and is well-suited for use in modern processors, supporting high-speed computations in diverse applications, from embedded systems to advanced computing platforms. This project provided me with hands-on experience in digital design, RTL coding, and simulation, utilizing industry-standard tools like Questa Sim, and further solidified my expertise in digital system development.
